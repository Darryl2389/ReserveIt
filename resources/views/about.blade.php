            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reserve It</span> is a dinner reservation app that was created & developed in 2019.
                The website was created by Darryl Sullivan & Oisin McCann who thought to use
                their knowledge of reservation apps to bring a new taste to the market. The goal of
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reserve It</span> is to offer a quick & easy application that a user can use to reserve a place a restaurant.
            </p>

            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reserve It</span> is partnered with a number of restaurants around Ireland from Cork & Galway to hotspots like Dublin & Belfast.
                We offer a variety of dining establishments & restaurants that range from bars & restaurants to city nightlife. We pride
                ourselves in how we treat our customers & always hold ourselves to an extremely high standard.
            </p>

            <p> In the future we plan to expand our business out to a global scale. We hope to expand the European continent & beyond in our
                quest for quick & easy reservations.
